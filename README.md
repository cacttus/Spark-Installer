# Spark Installer

This is a lightweight installer GUI application for Microsoft Windows.  The installer is capable of packaging application contents into a single executable with the contents appended to the end of the executable, and the GUI application as the start of the executable.  The installer GUI application guides users through application installation, similar to the many other popular installers.  The design GUI interface provides a fully configurable interface to the software distributor.  

For a C++ version of application packaging, see the exe-packer application.  That application provides a C++ interface to read contents from a packaged executable file.
