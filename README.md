# Spark Installer

This is a lightweight installer GUI application for Microsoft Windows.  The installer is capable of packaging application contents into a single executable with the contents appended to the end of the executable.  The installer GUI is launched whenever the user launches a packaged application. The launched GUI is fully configurable by the software distributor.  

For a C++ version of application packaging, see the exe-packer application.  That application provides a C++ interface to read contents from a packaged executable file.
